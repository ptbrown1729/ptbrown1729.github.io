Multicolor SIM implementations typically rely on liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) spatial light modulators (SLMs) for patterning the excitation light, but digital micromirror devices (DMDs) are a promising alternative, owing to their lower cost and higher speed. However, existing coherent DMD SIM implementations use only a single wavelength of light, limited by the lack of efficient approaches for solving the blazed grating effect for polychromatic light. We develop the requisite quantitative tools, including a closed form solution of the blaze and diffraction conditions, forward models of DMD diffraction and pattern projection, and a model of DMD aberrations. Based on these advances, we constructed a three-color DMD microscope, quantified the effect of aberrations from the DMD, developed a high-resolution optical transfer function measurement technique, and demonstrated SIM on fixed and live cells. This opens the door to applying DMDs in polychromatic applications previously restricted to LCoS SLMs.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Multicolor structured illumination microscopy and quantitative control of polychromatic light with a digital micromirror device","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elmer Guardado-Sanchez","Alan Morningstar","Benjamin M.

The tilt is along one of the principal directions of the two-dimensional square lattice and couples mass transport to local heating through energy conservation. Because of this coupling, the system quickly heats up to near infinite temperature in the lowest band of the lattice. We study the high-temperature transport and thermalization in our system by observing the decay of prepared initial density waves as a function of wavelength  and tilt strength and find that the associated decay time  crosses over as the tilt strength is increased from characteristically diffusive to subdiffusive with 4. In order to explain the underlying physics and emphasize its universal nature, we develop a hydrodynamic model that exhibits this crossover. For strong tilts, the subdiffusive transport rate is set by a thermal diffusivity, which we are thus able to measure as a function of tilt in this regime. We further support our understanding by probing the local inverse temperature of the system at strong tilts, finding good agreement with our theoretical predictions. Finally, we discuss the relation of the strongly tilted limit of our system to recently studied 1D models that may exhibit nonergodic dynamics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Subdiffusion and Heat Transport in a Tilted Two-Dimensional Fermi-Hubbard System","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1570107600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570107600,"objectID":"2136f2711efe46a72e5cbb2c5f8083e4","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/talk/2019-asu/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-asu/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Bad Metallic Transport in a Cold Atom Fermi-Hubbard System","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Peter T.

ARPES directly probes fermion pairing, and hence is a natural technique to study the development of superconductivity in systems ranging from high-temperature superconductors to unitary Fermi gases. In these systems, a remnant gap-like feature persists in the normal state. Developing a quantitative understanding of these so-called pseudogap regimes may elucidate details about the pairing mechanisms that lead to superconductivity, but this is difficult in real materials partly because the microscopic Hamiltonian is not known. Here, we report on the development of ARPES to study strongly interacting fermions in an optical lattice using a quantum gas microscope. We benchmark the technique by measuring the occupied single-particle spectral function of an attractive FermiHubbard system across the BCSBEC crossover and comparing the results to those of quantum Monte Carlo calculations. We find evidence for a pseudogap that opens well above the expected critical temperature for superfluidity. This technique may also be applied to the doped repulsive Hubbard model, which is expected to exhibit a pseudogap at temperatures close to those achieved in recent experiments.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of a Fermi-Hubbard system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter T.

The Fermi-Hubbard model is of great intrinsic interest as a toy model for strongly correlated quantum physics, and may also describe the phenomenology of high-temperature superconducting materials such as the cuprates. Most experimental studies of cold atom Fermi-Hubbard systems have focused on probing equal-time spin and density correlations, but a wide region of the low temperature phase diagram may be better understood by exploring dynamical (unequal-time) properties. In this thesis, we first report on an experiment exploring the response of antiferromagnetic spin correlations to a magnetic field, and find evidence for short-range canted antiferromagnetic spin correlations. Then we turn our focus to probing response functions associated with unequal-time correlations relevant for understanding the pseudogap and strange metal regimes of Fermi-Hubbard systems. First, we describe the development of a technique to measure microscopic diffusion, and hence resistivity, in doped Mott insulators. We find that this resistivity exhibits a linear dependence on temperature and violates the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, two signatures of strange metallic behavior. Next, we report on the development of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) compatible with quantum gas microscopy and its application to studying pseudogap physics in an attractive Fermi-Hubbard system across the BEC-BCS crossover, setting the stage for future studies of the pseudogap regime in repulsive Hubbard systems.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Probing Dynamical Quantities in the 2D Fermi-Hubbard Model with Quantum Gas Microscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1560430800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560430800,"objectID":"3229f99bfc8444410c72663c6cd117b8","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/talk/2019-kits/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-kits/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Probing dynamical properties of Fermi-Hubbard systems with a quantum gas microscope","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559221200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559221200,"objectID":"04071708490c63b7fc314ab48a9af7c8","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/talk/2019-damop/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-damop/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Photoemission spectroscopy of a Fermi-Hubbard system with a quantum gas microscope","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553864400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553864400,"objectID":"27a14d05bea8e7aa24ad3ac31827ef72","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/talk/2019-columbia/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-columbia/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Probing dynamical properties of Fermi-Hubbard systems with a quantum gas microscope","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1553864400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553864400,"objectID":"aa43021f61d7c7df807769d4269d963a","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/talk/2019-uchicago/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-uchicago/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Probing dynamical properties of Fermi-Hubbard systems with a quantum gas microscope","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1551790800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551790800,"objectID":"23e779007278ef62b7fb74b9c9a3dbd8","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/talk/2019-march-meeting/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-march-meeting/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Photoemission spectroscopy of a Fermi-Hubbard system with a quantum gas microscope","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550581200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550581200,"objectID":"1eb85f32f302a308ed20aa25305883ad","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/talk/2019-solvay/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-solvay/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Probing transport and spectral properties of Fermi-Hubbard systems with a quantum gas microscope","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Academic \rAcademic | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click \rPDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x -

To shed light on this problem, we study transport in a clean quantum system: ultracold lithium-6 in a two-dimensional optical lattice, a testing ground for strong interaction physics in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We determine the diffusion constant by measuring the relaxation of an imposed density modulation and modeling its decay hydrodynamically. The diffusion constant is converted to a resistivity by using the Nernst-Einstein relation. That resistivity exhibits a linear temperature dependence and shows no evidence of saturation, two characteristic signatures of a bad metal. The techniques we developed in this study may be applied to measurements of other transport quantities, including the optical conductivity and thermopower.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Bad metallic transport in a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elmer Guardado-Sanchez","Peter T.

Using a new technique for selective imaging of doublons with a quantum gas microscope, we observe chequerboard doublon density correlations in the normal state close to half-filling. With the aid of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the measured doublon density correlations allow us to put a lower bound on the strength of s-wave pairing correlations in our system. We compare the temperature sensitivity of the doublon density correlations and the paired atom fraction and find the correlations to be a much better thermometer. Accurate thermometry of attractive lattice systems will be essential in the quest for optimizing cooling schemes to reach superfluid phases in future experiments.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Quantum gas microscopy of an attractive Fermi-Hubbard system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter T.

Our results pave the way to experimentally mapping the low-temperature phase diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model as a function of both doping and spin polarization, for which many open questions remain.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Spin-imbalance in a 2D Fermi-Hubbard system","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496754000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496754000,"objectID":"a874c24e1eebe3d06c60c99e9d0704b7","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/talk/2017-damop/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2017-damop/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Spin-imbalance in a 2D Fermi-Hubbard system","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Debayan Mitra","Peter T.

We probe the gas at different interaction strengths and polarizations by measuring the density of each spin component in the trap and the pair momentum distribution after time of flight. For a wide range of experimental parameters, we observe in-trap phase separation characterized by the appearance of a spin-balanced core surrounded by a polarized gas. Our momentum space measurements indicate pair condensation in the imbalanced gas even for large polarizations where phase separation vanishes, pointing to the presence of a polarized pair condensate. Our observation of zero momentum pair condensates in 2D spin-imbalanced gases opens the way to explorations of more exotic superfluid phases that occupy a large part of the phase diagram in lower dimensions.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Phase Separation and Pair Condensation in a Spin-Imbalanced 2D Fermi Gas","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Sample text\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"8f66d660a9a2edc2d08e68cc30f701f7","permalink":"https://ptbrown1729.github.io/project/internal-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/internal-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of using the in-built project page.","tags":["Deep Learning"],"title":"Internal Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Peter T.
