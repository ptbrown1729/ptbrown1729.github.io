[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Peter is a physicist broadly interested in quantitative microscopy of complex systems. He earned his PhD from Princeton University in 2019 in the group of Waseem Bakr where he studied ultracold atomic Fermi gases in optical lattices. At Princeton he built a quantum gas microscope to simulate models of high-temperature superconductivity. Much of his work focused on exploring transport properties of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model in regimes where exact computational approaches are intractable. These quantum simulation experiments established that the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model exhibits similar charge transport phenomonology to the cuprate strange metals.\nCurrently he is a postdoc in Doug Shepherd\u0026rsquo;s group, the quantitative imaging and inference lab, in the Center for Biological Physics and the Department of Physics at Arizona State University. Here, Peter has used his expertise in optics and computational techniques to develop new tools for bio-imaging. Past projects include developing a multicolor structured illumination microscope (SIM) with coherent light and a digital mirror device (DMD) and characterizing the hydrodynamic efficiency of the E. coli flagellum using oblique plane lightsheet microscopy. His interests include super-resolution imaging using structured light, high-speed 3D quantitative phase imaging, and computational imaging. Currently he is developing high-speed, high-fidelity approaches to quantitative phase imaging which may be applied to a variety of interesting questions related to single-cellular swimmers in complex environments, motility, and colloidal physics. A major theme which runs through both areas of his work is the role of fluctuations in microscopic systems.\nFor more information about Peter\u0026rsquo;s research interests and publications, see his CV and Google Scholar page (above).
