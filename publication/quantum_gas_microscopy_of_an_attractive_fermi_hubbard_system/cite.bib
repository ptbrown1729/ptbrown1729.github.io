 abstract = {The attractive FermiHubbard model is the simplest theoretical model for studying pairing and superconductivity of fermions on a lattice. It exhibits many interesting features including a short-coherence length at intermediate coupling and a pseudogap regime with anomalous properties. Here we study an experimental realization of this model using a two-dimensional (2D) atomic Fermi gas in an optical lattice. Using a new technique for selective imaging of doublons with a quantum gas microscope, we observe chequerboard doublon density correlations in the normal state close to half-filling. With the aid of quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the measured doublon density correlations allow us to put a lower bound on the strength of s-wave pairing correlations in our system. We compare the temperature sensitivity of the doublon density correlations and the paired atom fraction and find the correlations to be a much better thermometer. Accurate thermometry of attractive lattice systems will be essential in the quest for optimizing cooling schemes to reach superfluid phases in future experiments.},
