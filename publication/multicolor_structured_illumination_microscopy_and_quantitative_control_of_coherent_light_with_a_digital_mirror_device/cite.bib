 abstract = {We demonstrate structured illumination microscopy (SIM) at three wavelengths using a digital mirror device (DMD), an approach which has not previously been realized due to the DMD{\textquoteright}s blazed grating effect. Previous approaches to SIM using a DMD have used one color of coherent light or multiple colors via incoherent projection. To address this challenge, we develop a forward model of DMD diffraction, a forward model of coherent pattern projection, and identify an experimentally feasible configuration for three common fluorophore wavelengths. Based on these results, we constructed a custom DMD SIM and created an open-source software suite to simulate, calibrate, execute, and reconstruct 2D linear SIM data. We validate this approach by demonstrating resolution enhancement for known calibration samples and fixed cells.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
